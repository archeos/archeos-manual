Introduction to ArcheOS
=======================

.. include:: global.rst

ArcheOS is a free operating system built with archaeologist needs in mind.  
Is based on `Debian <http://www.debian.org/>`_ which is one of the most popular, secure, stable and reliable **GNU/Linux** distributions. This means that part of the software is maintained by Debian and not by ArcheOS developers.  
The software that is not available on the Debian repositories but we consider important to include into the distribution is choosen, tested and packaged by our developers (all volunteers) and made available to you.

All software present in ArcheOS is **open source** and where possible, *free software*. If you don't know what that it means or you are not sure about what advantages this can bring to your work, please see the `Wikipedia page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software>`_ about.
