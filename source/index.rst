ArcheOS Documentation
=====================

.. include:: global.rst

This is the official page for **ArcheOS** documentation.  
Are you looking for `ArcheOS homepage <http://www.archeos.eu/>`_? Or you want to `download it <http://www.archeos.eu/wiki/doku.php?id=download>`_?

Here you can find information about the operating system itself (how to install it, how to upgrade it, etc.) and about the applications installed. A list of tutorials is also present, be sure to check first that the version of ArcheOS you are using is listed on the top of the tutorial's page.  
This documentation (slightly modified) is installed also in every ArcheOS operating system from version 5 (theodoric), users can browse it offline pointing their preferred browser to `/usr/share/archeos-manual/html/index.html <file:///usr/share/archeos-manual/html/index.html>`_.

Download this documentation in **PDF** or **ePub** formats.
