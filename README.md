Archeos-manual - The Official ArcheOS Documentation
===================================================

This README file contains the some useful notice about the ArcheOS documentation package and source.
The documentation is build using [Sphinx] [1], so check how to use it and all the dependencies into the "Dependencies" section.

Overview
--------

The aim of this documentation is to provide a single entry-point where all resources about ArcheOS are stored and where all people working on the distribution can collaborate.
The documentation is written in the [Markdown] [2] markup language, then compiled in various formats (see Formats section).
HTML and MAN pages are used to build the debian package too, while other formats (HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.) are made available to the ArcheOS website (see Automation section).
